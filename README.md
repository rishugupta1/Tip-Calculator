# Tip-Calculator
A tip calculator is a handy tool used to determine the appropriate gratuity or tip amount to add to a bill in restaurants, bars, or other service establishments. It's particularly useful when splitting bills among multiple people or when you want to ensure a fair and reasonable tip based on the quality of service received.

The typical features of a tip calculator include:

1. **Bill Amount:** Input field where you enter the total cost of the services or items purchased.

2. **Tip Percentage:** Options to select a percentage of the bill amount to tip, commonly ranging from 10% to 25% or more.

3. **Number of People:** Option to specify the number of individuals splitting the bill, if applicable.

4. **Calculate Button:** A button that, when clicked, computes the tip amount and optionally divides the total bill (including tip) by the number of people.

5. **Tip Amount:** Display of the calculated tip amount based on the bill total and selected tip percentage.

6. **Total Amount:** Display of the total amount to be paid, including the bill total and tip amount.

7. **Amount per Person:** Display of the total amount each person should contribute if the bill is being split.

Using a tip calculator can help ensure fair compensation for service staff and prevent any confusion or awkwardness when settling the bill. It promotes transparency and convenience in the tipping process, making dining or enjoying services a smoother experience for everyone involved.
